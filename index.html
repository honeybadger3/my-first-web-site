  <h2>Winnie the Pooh</h2>
  The Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, including Alexander Lenard's Latin translation, Winnie ille Pu, which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on The New York Times Best Seller list.[1]

  <p>In 1961, Walt Disney Productions licensed certain film and other rights of Milne's  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh" target="_blank" title="Winnie the Pooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a> stories from the estate of A. A. Milne and the licensing agent Stephen Slesinger, Inc., and adapted the Pooh stories, using the unhyphenated name "Winnie the Pooh", into a series of features that would eventually become one of its most successful franchises.</p>
  <p>In popular film adaptations, Pooh has been voiced by actors Sterling Holloway, Hal Smith, and Jim Cummings in English, and Yevgeny Leonov in Russian.</p>
