  <h2>Tigger</h2>
  Tigger is very cute.
  <p>Like other Pooh characters, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigger" target="_blank" title="titi">Tigger</a> is based on one of <strong>Christopher <u>Robin</u> Milne's</strong> stuffed toy animals.He appears in the Disney cartoon versions of Winnie the Pooh and has also appeared in his own film, The Tigger Movie (2000).</p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">He is known for his distinctive orange and black stripes, large eyes, a long chin, a springy tail, and his love of bouncing. As he says himself, "Bouncing is what Tiggers do best." Tigger never refers to himself as a tiger, but as a "Tigger". Although he often refers to himself in the third person plural (e.g. "Tiggers don't like honey!"), he maintains that he is "the only one".</p>
