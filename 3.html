  <h2>Piglet</h2>
  Piglet is very cute.
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_(Winnie-the-Pooh)" target="_blank" title="piggy">Piglet</a> is introduced in the text from <strong>Chapter III</strong> of Winnie-the-Pooh, although he is shown earlier in one of the illustrations for Chapter II. He also appears in Chapters V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X, as well as every chapter of The House at Pooh Corner. Piglet is best friends with Pooh and is also especially close to Christopher Robin and the rest of the main characters.</p>
